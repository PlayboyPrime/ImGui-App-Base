# ImGui-App-Base
A app base made with [ImGui Docking](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/docking). Has dockable tabs similar to google chrome

This is my first ever release of an actual application so there might be some issues

Currently there is a known issue when resizing the main window into a undocked window then helpers::d3d::ResetDevice will return D3DERR_INVALIDCALL. But its just ignored and the app will still work
